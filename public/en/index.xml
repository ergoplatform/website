As part of an ongoing joint initiative, Ergo and Cardano unveiled the design of a new stablecoin at the online Ergo Summit event, held on 23 January.
Named AgeUSD and inspired by StatiCoin, the stablecoin is the result of a collaboration between research and development teams across three organisations: IOG (IOHK), the company leading Cardano core development; Ergo Foundation; and blockchain technology company, Emurgo, also one of the founding members of Cardano.</description></item><item><title>NVMiner 1.1.0 with improved hashrate(3-4x) by Mhs_sam</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2021-02-04-nvminer-1-1-0-with-improved-hashrate-3-4x-by-mhs_sam/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Feb 2021 16:30:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2021-02-04-nvminer-1-1-0-with-improved-hashrate-3-4x-by-mhs_sam/</guid><description/></item><item><title>“Hardening” Hard Fork Post-Mortem</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2021-02-03-hardening-hard-fork-post-mortem/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Feb 2021 07:06:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2021-02-03-hardening-hard-fork-post-mortem/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Ergo Mainnet 4.0.4 Release</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2021-02-02-ergo-mainnet-4-0-4-release/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Feb 2021 21:32:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2021-02-02-ergo-mainnet-4-0-4-release/</guid><description/></item><item><title>"You can mine ERGO coin with us after "The Hardening" protocol upgrade at block 417,792 around 16:00 February 2th"</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2021-02-02-you-can-mine-ergo-coin-with-us-after-the-hardening-protocol-upgrade-at-block-417-792-around-16-00-february-2th/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Feb 2021 07:21:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2021-02-02-you-can-mine-ergo-coin-with-us-after-the-hardening-protocol-upgrade-at-block-417-792-around-16-00-february-2th/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Ergo added to https://666pool.cn mining pool</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2021-02-01-ergo-added-to-https-666pool-cn-mining-pool/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Feb 2021 09:52:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2021-02-01-ergo-added-to-https-666pool-cn-mining-pool/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Ergo Mainnet 4.0.3 released</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2021-02-01-ergo-mainnet-4-0-3-released/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Feb 2021 09:38:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2021-02-01-ergo-mainnet-4-0-3-released/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Ergo is on https://WoolyPooly.com mining pool!</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2021-02-01-ergo-is-on-http-woolypooly-com-mining-pool/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Feb 2021 08:36:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2021-02-01-ergo-is-on-http-woolypooly-com-mining-pool/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Autolykos v.2 added to SRBMiner-Multi CPU &amp;

With the explosion of interest in DeFi, perhaps the most compelling use case for smart contract blockchain platforms, one thing has become abundantly clear: blockchain is not ready for DeFi.
DeFi dApps have overloaded the Ethereum blockchain, causing long delays and soaring fees for transactions. Ethereum and many other platforms besides have researched and implemented fixes to address the lack of capacity.</description></item><item><title>Ergo Mainnet 4.0.0 Release - Please update your nodes</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2021-01-18-ergo-mainnet-4-0-0-release-please-update-your-nodes/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Jan 2021 06:05:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2021-01-18-ergo-mainnet-4-0-0-release-please-update-your-nodes/</guid><description/></item><item><title>We're holding the 2021 Ergo Summit!</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2021-01-15-were-holding-the-2021-ergo-summit/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Jan 2021 07:28:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2021-01-15-were-holding-the-2021-ergo-summit/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Instant Ergo web wallet for experiments and temporary usage (not HODL)</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2021-01-15-instant-ergo-web-wallet-for-experiments-and-temporary-usage-not-hodl/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Jan 2021 07:26:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2021-01-15-instant-ergo-web-wallet-for-experiments-and-temporary-usage-not-hodl/</guid><description/></item><item><title>If you want to help the project with promotion, then join our special chat room on Telegram</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2021-01-15-if-you-want-to-help-the-project-with-promotion-then-join-our-special-chat-room-on-telegram/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Jan 2021 07:22:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2021-01-15-if-you-want-to-help-the-project-with-promotion-then-join-our-special-chat-room-on-telegram/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Here are our winners of articles contest - Verium fellow, JAGO and Can Degen</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2021-01-09-here-are-our-winners-of-articles-contest-verium-fellow-jago-and-can-degen/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Jan 2021 16:38:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2021-01-09-here-are-our-winners-of-articles-contest-verium-fellow-jago-and-can-degen/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Unblocked with Robert Kornacki</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2021-01-08-unblocked-with-robert-kornacki/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Jan 2021 19:32:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2021-01-08-unblocked-with-robert-kornacki/</guid><description/></item><item><title>What Ergo can contribute to DeFi interoperability</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-01-05-what-ergo-can-contribute-to-defi-interoperability/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jan 2021 07:08:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-01-05-what-ergo-can-contribute-to-defi-interoperability/</guid><description>Most users won’t care about the underlying blockchain they’re using – they will just want its functionality. That means DeFi interoperability will be critical.
Despite the open source nature of the blockchain world, crypto projects have always tended to have an ‘us-and-them’ mentality. The assumption is that for one platform to succeed, it must be at the expense of all the others. Hence marketing strategies that position one or other platform as the ‘Ethereum killer’, and other such claims.</description></item><item><title>Ergo Platform Ecosystem Digest - December 2020</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2021-01-03-ergo-platform-ecosystem-digest-december-2020/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jan 2021 15:33:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2021-01-03-ergo-platform-ecosystem-digest-december-2020/</guid><description/></item><item><title>HeroMiners - "We opened testnet ERGO pool"</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2021-01-03-herominers-we-opened-testnet-ergo-pool/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jan 2021 15:39:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2021-01-03-herominers-we-opened-testnet-ergo-pool/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Happy New Year Ergonauts!</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2021-01-03-happy-new-year-ergonauts/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Dec 2020 15:31:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2021-01-03-happy-new-year-ergonauts/</guid><description/></item><item><title>A new tutorial on ErgoMixer by Anon2020s and Sakata</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2021-01-03-a-new-tutorial-on-ergomixer-by-anon2020s-and-sakata/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Dec 2020 15:28:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2021-01-03-a-new-tutorial-on-ergomixer-by-anon2020s-and-sakata/</guid><description/></item><item><title>A tool for airdrops added to ErgoUtils by Anon_real</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2021-01-03-a-tool-for-airdrops-added-to-ergoutils-by-anon_real/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Dec 2020 15:26:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2021-01-03-a-tool-for-airdrops-added-to-ergoutils-by-anon_real/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Introducing the Sigmaverse</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-12-27-introducing-the-sigmaverse/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Dec 2020 20:20:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-12-27-introducing-the-sigmaverse/</guid><description>Your portal to Ergo’s dApp universe is opening.
Ergo has some amazing tech and some talented developers. However, as a decentralised and community-powered platform, it’s not always easy to know what’s going on all the time. Different people are developing different dApps and use cases, formally and informally. Connecting them to the same users and building that all-important DeFi network effect isn’t always easy.
That’s what the Sigmaverse is about. Sigmaverse is a one-stop portal to the Ergo dApp ecosystem: a place where users can find all the cool functionality that community developers are building on Ergo, all in one place.</description></item><item><title>ErgoMixer v3.2.0, ZeroJoin for ERG and tokens on Ergo released by Anon2020s</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-12-27-ergomixer-v3-2-0-zerojoin-for-erg-and-tokens-on-ergo-released-by-anon2020s/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Dec 2020 18:46:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-12-27-ergomixer-v3-2-0-zerojoin-for-erg-and-tokens-on-ergo-released-by-anon2020s/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Details on updated Proof-of-Work scheme Autolykos v.2</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-12-27-details-on-updated-proof-of-work-scheme-autolykos-v-2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Dec 2020 18:36:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-12-27-details-on-updated-proof-of-work-scheme-autolykos-v-2/</guid><description/></item><item><title>From the family at Ergo, we present The Sigmaverse</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-12-23-from-the-family-at-ergo-we-present-the-sigmaverse/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Dec 2020 21:51:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-12-23-from-the-family-at-ergo-we-present-the-sigmaverse/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Hardening protocol upgrade activation is set to block 414,720</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-12-23-the-hardening-protocol-upgrade-activation-is-set-to-block-414-720/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Dec 2020 15:08:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-12-23-the-hardening-protocol-upgrade-activation-is-set-to-block-414-720/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Ergo protocol reference client 4.0.0 (The Hardening Upgrade) pre-release</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-12-23-ergo-protocol-reference-client-4-0-0-the-hardening-upgrade-pre-release/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Dec 2020 07:29:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-12-23-ergo-protocol-reference-client-4-0-0-the-hardening-upgrade-pre-release/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Ergo Summit 2021 - Entering The New Era, Announcing AgeUSD &amp; The Hardening Upgrade</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-12-23-ergo-summit-2021-entering-the-new-era-announcing-ageusd-the-hardening-upgrade/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Dec 2020 07:08:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-12-23-ergo-summit-2021-entering-the-new-era-announcing-ageusd-the-hardening-upgrade/</guid><description/></item><item><title>"Tutorial #3 for the Headless dApp Framework is out" by Emurgo</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-12-18-tutorial-3-for-the-headless-dapp-framework-is-out-by-emurgo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Dec 2020 16:37:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-12-18-tutorial-3-for-the-headless-dapp-framework-is-out-by-emurgo/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Love Ergo Platform?

As 2020 draws to a close, it’s worth looking back at what has been a landmark year for crypto and DeFi.
Since the COVID-induced global market turbulence of March, we have seen crypto establish itself as an asset class as corporate investors began buying bitcoin as a store of value and a hedge against dollar devaluation in the wake of unprecedented money printing.</description></item><item><title>Ergo Mainnet 3.3.7 released</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-12-16-ergo-mainnet-3-3-7-released/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Dec 2020 20:31:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-12-16-ergo-mainnet-3-3-7-released/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Understanding Headless dApps with Robert Kornacki</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-12-16-understanding-headless-dapps-with-robert-kornacki/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Dec 2020 20:32:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-12-16-understanding-headless-dapps-with-robert-kornacki/</guid><description/></item><item><title>In less time it takes to make cereal, launch your NFT artwork auction on Ergo with any wallet</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-12-16-in-less-time-it-takes-to-make-cereal-launch-your-nft-artwork-auction-on-ergo-with-any-wallet/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Dec 2020 20:28:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-12-16-in-less-time-it-takes-to-make-cereal-launch-your-nft-artwork-auction-on-ergo-with-any-wallet/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Welcome to a new era of Ergo ecosystem development!</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-12-16-welcome-to-a-new-era-of-ergo-ecosystem-development/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Dec 2020 20:29:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-12-16-welcome-to-a-new-era-of-ergo-ecosystem-development/</guid><description/></item><item><title> Ergo Bootstrap, Streamlining Ergo dApp Infrastructure With One Simple Tool</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-12-11-ergo-bootstrap-streamlining-ergo-dapp-infrastructure-with-one-simple-tool/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Dec 2020 12:03:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-12-11-ergo-bootstrap-streamlining-ergo-dapp-infrastructure-with-one-simple-tool/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Ergo Bootstrap, Streamlining Ergo dApp Infrastructure With One Simple Tool</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-12-11-ergo-bootstrap-streamlining-ergo-dapp-infrastructure-with-one-simple-tool/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Dec 2020 09:00:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-12-11-ergo-bootstrap-streamlining-ergo-dapp-infrastructure-with-one-simple-tool/</guid><description>The Ergo ecosystem is quickly growing with new design patterns, tools, dApps, and more every single month. This is an exciting point in time for developers to jump in and get started.
That said, while building dApps on top of Ergo, vital infrastructure components to develop and run your dApp might be intimidating to set up for someone who is unfamiliar with the existing tooling. Between an Ergo full node, explorer back end, explorer front end, logging, and metrics, it can become quite overwhelming for a nascent dApp developer entering into the ecosystem.</description></item><item><title>Ergo Headless dApp Framework Now Available</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-12-09-ergo-headless-dapp-framework-now-available/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Dec 2020 12:19:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-12-09-ergo-headless-dapp-framework-now-available/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Ergo Headless dApp Framework Now Available</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-12-08-ergo-headless-dapp-framework-now-available/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Dec 2020 09:10:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-12-08-ergo-headless-dapp-framework-now-available/</guid><description>This new development will have a number of implications for the Ergo ecosystem and developers, making it far easier to build applications on Ergo.
In a recent article, we looked at the idea of ‘Headless’ dApps: portable dApp off-chain code that can be used by anyone to ship dApps easily by plugging different components together and adding an interface. On 30 November, a new release was made from the Emurgo code repository: the Ergo Headless dApp Framework (HDF)!</description></item><item><title>Ergo/Emurgo Stable Coin, NFT, Mixer, and more! | The Cardano Aura #9</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-12-07-ergo-emurgo-stable-coin-nft-mixer-and-more-the-cardano-aura-9/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Dec 2020 09:24:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-12-07-ergo-emurgo-stable-coin-nft-mixer-and-more-the-cardano-aura-9/</guid><description/></item><item><title>New Ergo Smart DEX Orders with buyback guarantees</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-12-02-new-ergo-smart-dex-orders-with-buyback-guarantees/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Dec 2020 18:43:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-12-02-new-ergo-smart-dex-orders-with-buyback-guarantees/</guid><description>The novel smart contract will trustlessly enable users to participate in token sales without the downside risks of regular ICOs.
2020 is shaping up to look at a lot like 2016 for crypto – suggesting that 2021 could be another 2017.
But while 2017’s epic crypto bull run was partially driven by the massive ICO hype, 2020’s has not been – and any continuing rally in 2021 will likewise not rely on these token sales.</description></item><item><title>Ergo "Headless dApp Framework" just released by Emurgo</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-12-01-ergo-headless-dapp-framework-just-released-by-emurgo/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2020 07:54:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-12-01-ergo-headless-dapp-framework-just-released-by-emurgo/</guid><description/></item><item><title>ErgoTree &amp; ErgoScript 3.3.3 Release</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-12-01-ergotree-ergoscript-3-3-3-release/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2020 07:51:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-12-01-ergotree-ergoscript-3-3-3-release/</guid><description/></item><item><title>An introduction to ‘Headless’ dApps</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-11-28-an-introduction-to-headless-dapps/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Nov 2020 17:01:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-11-28-an-introduction-to-headless-dapps/</guid><description/></item><item><title>An introduction to ‘Headless’ dApps</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-11-27-an-introduction-to-headless-dapps/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Nov 2020 10:17:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-11-27-an-introduction-to-headless-dapps/</guid><description>This new approach offers a streamlined interface for interacting with on-chain contracts, enabling anyone to build dApps using simple building blocks.

Non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, aren’t a new development, but with the rise of the DeFi space they are gaining significance and finding new use cases.
NFTs are indivisible unique or limited-edition tokens that can be used to represent physical or digital items: anything from a house or car to a piece of digital art, a series of images, an in-game item or other collectible.</description></item><item><title>Learn ErgoScript by Example</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-10-12-learn-ergoscript-by-example/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Oct 2020 08:14:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-10-12-learn-ergoscript-by-example/</guid><description>The new resources provide a powerful but simple way to learn UTXO-based smart contracts.

As a DeFi platform that takes positioning for the future seriously, it’s important that Ergo has a vision – not only a sense of where things might be heading, but the role that it should itself be playing as these new decentralised financial services consolidate and grow in popularity.</description></item><item><title>Ergo Platform Ecosystem Digest - September 2020</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-10-02-ergo-platform-ecosystem-digest-september-2020/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Oct 2020 07:09:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-10-02-ergo-platform-ecosystem-digest-september-2020/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Ergo Utilities - General utilities to make writing off-chain Ergo code in Rust simpler</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-09-30-ergo-utilities-general-utilities-to-make-writing-off-chain-ergo-code-in-rust-simpler/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Sep 2020 10:10:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-09-30-ergo-utilities-general-utilities-to-make-writing-off-chain-ergo-code-in-rust-simpler/</guid><description/></item><item><title>ErgoTree &amp; ErgoScript 3.3.1 released</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-09-30-ergotree-ergoscript-3-3-1-released/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Sep 2020 10:03:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-09-30-ergotree-ergoscript-3-3-1-released/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Ergo Cast is now back online, now with a new co-host Sakata</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-09-28-ergo-cast-is-now-back-online-now-with-a-new-co-host-sakata/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Sep 2020 15:40:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-09-28-ergo-cast-is-now-back-online-now-with-a-new-co-host-sakata/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Ergo explorer backend 3.2.1 released</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-09-28-ergo-explorer-backend-3-2-1-released/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Sep 2020 15:38:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-09-28-ergo-explorer-backend-3-2-1-released/</guid><description/></item><item><title>NFTs on Ergo</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-09-25-nfts-on-ergo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Sep 2020 06:50:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-09-25-nfts-on-ergo/</guid><description/></item><item><title>NFTs on Ergo</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-09-25-nfts-on-ergo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Sep 2020 05:58:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-09-25-nfts-on-ergo/</guid><description>As with almost every other area of DeFi, Ergo Platform takes a different approach to NFTs that offers some interesting and unique use cases and benefits.
NFTs look set to become the next major frontier for blockchain. Over the course of this year, crypto has become an accepted and practically mainstream (if still new) means of hedging against inflation and storing value. The emergence of DeFi as a use case for blockchain has similarly been impressive over the past few months, regardless of the issues that still need to be solved.</description></item><item><title>“Emurgo is connected to Cardano.

This is the nature of open, decentralised systems. You can’t stop it, and there’s a very strong argument for saying we shouldn’t try. To restrict any element of DeFi, at least at the protocol level, is to introduce centralisation and single points of failure, thereby killing the core innovation by misguidedly trying to protect it.</description></item><item><title>Ergo Platform Mainnet 3.3.3 released</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-09-16-ergo-platform-mainnet-3-3-3-released/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Sep 2020 16:53:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-09-16-ergo-platform-mainnet-3-3-3-released/</guid><description/></item><item><title>"Unlocking The Potential Of The UTXO Model" by Emurgo Research</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-09-14-unlocking-the-potential-of-the-utxo-model-by-emurgo-research/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Sep 2020 18:50:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-09-14-unlocking-the-potential-of-the-utxo-model-by-emurgo-research/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Explorer backend 3.1.0 released</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-09-16-explorer-backend-3-1-0-has-been-released/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Sep 2020 16:57:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-09-16-explorer-backend-3-1-0-has-been-released/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Oracle Pools and Interoperability of Cardano and Ergo with Robert Kornacki | TCE 105</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-09-13-oracle-pools-and-interoperability-of-cardano-and-ergo-with-robert-kornacki-tce-105/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Sep 2020 16:28:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-09-13-oracle-pools-and-interoperability-of-cardano-and-ergo-with-robert-kornacki-tce-105/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Ergo Platform Mainnet 3.3.2 released</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-09-11-ergo-platform-mainnet-3-3-2-released/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Sep 2020 18:02:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-09-11-ergo-platform-mainnet-3-3-2-released/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Announcing the ZK Treasury on Ergo!</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-09-04-announcing-the-zk-treasury-on-ergo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Sep 2020 20:13:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-09-04-announcing-the-zk-treasury-on-ergo/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Announcing the ZK Treasury on Ergo!</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-09-04-announcing-the-zk-treasury-on-ergo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Sep 2020 18:54:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-09-04-announcing-the-zk-treasury-on-ergo/</guid><description>Ergo’s Zero-Knowledge Treasury enables users to easily create joint digital signatures, with bespoke conditions for spending funds, while ensuring the signatories to the created address remain hidden.

It is decentralisation that brings the benefits of transparency, accessibility, security, immutability, composability, efficiency and more besides to these new financial initiatives.
As a DeFi platform that aims to take and build on the best features of Bitcoin, Ergo is committed to decentralisation.
And so it is with a mixture of interest, concern, excitement, dismay and, frankly, awe that we watch the current DeFi craze for Yield Farming unfold.</description></item><item><title>"ZeroJoin: Combining ZeroCoin and CoinJoin" has been accepted to CBT2020 workshop</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-09-04-zerojoin-combining-zerocoin-and-coinjoin-has-been-accepted-to-cbt2020-workshop/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2020 20:16:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-09-04-zerojoin-combining-zerocoin-and-coinjoin-has-been-accepted-to-cbt2020-workshop/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Ergo’s Oracle Pools, and what they mean for the ecosystem</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-09-04-ergos-oracle-pools-and-what-they-mean-for-the-ecosystem/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Aug 2020 20:11:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-09-04-ergos-oracle-pools-and-what-they-mean-for-the-ecosystem/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Ergo’s Oracle Pools, and what they mean for the ecosystem</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-08-31-ergos-oracle-pools-and-what-they-mean-for-the-ecosystem/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Aug 2020 09:31:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-08-31-ergos-oracle-pools-and-what-they-mean-for-the-ecosystem/</guid><description>The new scheme developed through the Emurgo-Ergo partnership will see oracle pools – core blockchain infrastructure – run as a public service, accessible by any dApp and developer, free at the point of use.
Oracles are a crucial element of DeFi infrastructure. They are the bridge between the siloed world of the blockchain and data from the real world, and so are vital for DeFi to reach its full potential. The integrity of major use cases, including stablecoins and lending platforms, rely on oracles that are fit for purpose.</description></item><item><title>"Today EMURGO and Ergo platform mark a historic moment for UTXO based dApps and DeFi applications"</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-08-28-today-emurgo-and-ergo-platform-mark-a-historic-moment-for-utxo-based-dapps-and-defi-applications/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 20:12:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-08-28-today-emurgo-and-ergo-platform-mark-a-historic-moment-for-utxo-based-dapps-and-defi-applications/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Transcript of the Oracle Pools Q&amp;A session with Robert Kornacki</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-09-04-transcript-of-the-oracle-pools-q-a-session-with-robert-kornacki/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 20:09:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-09-04-transcript-of-the-oracle-pools-q-a-session-with-robert-kornacki/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Transcript of the Oracle Pools Q&amp;A session with Robert Kornacki</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-08-28-transcript-of-first-q-a-session-with-robert-kornacki/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 18:59:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-08-28-transcript-of-first-q-a-session-with-robert-kornacki/</guid><description>Robert Kornacki

Money is changing. It’s interesting that, at a time when money is increasingly being trivialised and devalued through enormous quantitative easing, evolution and innovation in a parallel sphere is qualitatively improving money. One of the key ways in which blockchain is enhancing money is programmability.
Money is just information. Once that basic principle has been accepted, it opens a whole new arena and value proposition for cash.</description></item><item><title>"App on Distributed Signatures"</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-08-20-app-on-distributed-signatures/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Aug 2020 19:24:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-08-20-app-on-distributed-signatures/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Ergo Platform Reference Client 3.3.1 has been released</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-08-20-ergo-platform-reference-client-3-3-1-has-been-released/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Aug 2020 18:41:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-08-20-ergo-platform-reference-client-3-3-1-has-been-released/</guid><description/></item><item><title>"EMURGO is pleased to officially announce that EMURGO’s Head of R&amp;D and smart contract developer Robert Kornacki was appointed as a new board member of the Ergo Foundation."</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-08-18-emurgo-is-pleased-to-officially-announce-that-emurgos-head-of-r-d-and-smart-contract-developer-robert-kornacki-was-appointed-as-a-new-board-member-of-the-ergo-foundation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Aug 2020 19:51:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-08-18-emurgo-is-pleased-to-officially-announce-that-emurgos-head-of-r-d-and-smart-contract-developer-robert-kornacki-was-appointed-as-a-new-board-member-of-the-ergo-foundation/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Ergo’s Vision for DeFi: Ergo vs CBDCs</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-08-18-ergos-vision-for-defi-ergo-vs-cbdcs/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Aug 2020 19:49:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020-08-18-ergos-vision-for-defi-ergo-vs-cbdcs/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Ergo’s Vision for DeFi: Ergo vs CBDCs</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-08-17-ergos-vision-for-defi-ergo-vs-cbdcs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Aug 2020 18:44:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-08-17-ergos-vision-for-defi-ergo-vs-cbdcs/</guid><description>As blockchain technology gains traction, central bank digital currencies are among the most significant applications being developed.

The narrative around blockchain technology is evolving in front of us. The use cases for smart contract platforms are becoming clearer by the day, encapsulated in the catch-all term of ‘DeFi’, or Decentralised Finance.
DeFi services are often much like their traditional counterparts, including lending and derivatives platforms, as well as more exotic services.</description></item><item><title>Ergo-Emurgo partnership yields new model for oracles</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_06_30_ergo_emurgo_oracles/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_06_30_ergo_emurgo_oracles/</guid><description>The joint research on oracle pools will be implemented in the Ergo stablecoin project.
Oracles are one of the critical elements of DeFi, providing a link between the siloed and self-contained world of the blockchain, and real-world data. It is imperative that dApps have access to reliable price data, among other information, in order to execute effectively and securely.

Introduction ErgoScript is the smart contract language used by the Ergo blockchain. While it has concise syntax adopted from Scala/Kotlin, it still may seem confusing at first because conceptually ErgoScript is quite different compared to conventional languages which we all know and love. This is because Ergo is a UTXO based blockchain, whereas smart contracts are traditionally associated with account based systems like Ethereum.</description></item><item><title>FlowCards: A Declarative Framework for Development of Ergo dApps</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020_04_29/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020_04_29/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Building Ergo: Atomic Swaps</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_04_24_atomic_swaps/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_04_24_atomic_swaps/</guid><description>Because a blockchain is a siloed, self-contained system by design, interacting with other blockchain protocols is challenging. Atomic Swaps enable cross-chain exchange of digital assets, avoiding the need for centralised exchanges.
Blockchains are excellent at decentralised value transfer within their own domains. That is, you can send BTC to any Bitcoin address securely and easily, and you can send LTC to any Litecoin address securely and easily too.
But because blockchains are based on consensus between miners, they are not designed to interface with other blockchains.</description></item><item><title>Building Ergo: Atomic Swaps</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020_04_24/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020_04_24/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Building Ergo: Oracles</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_04_04_building_ergo_oracles/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_04_04_building_ergo_oracles/</guid><description>Blockchains are siloed systems that can only reference their own data, established by consensus. Oracles are the solution to the problem of working with external information, which is vital for many everyday use cases.
Blockchains are intentionally self-contained. They reference information only recorded within their immediate ecosystem, that has been agreed upon by a majority of miners. Since the whole point of a blockchain, based on consensus, is that there are no sources of centralisation or single points of failure, that poses a problem.</description></item><item><title>Building Ergo: Oracles</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020_04_23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020_04_23/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Building Ergo: Storage rent</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_04_21_ergo_positioning/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_04_21_ergo_positioning/</guid><description>We’ve designed Ergo with long-term economic sustainability in mind, and storage rent is one of the ways we’re ensuring miners stay profitable well into the future. One community member, Robert, describes this function as ‘on-chain garbage collection’ that reduces the problem of blockchain bloat – and even makes it profitable.
The 2020 block reward reduction will probably be the most important halving Bitcoin ever experiences. This is the point where the narrative of programmatic scarcity and digital gold will truly be proven, in the context of the sharpest economic downturn in living memory.</description></item><item><title>Building Ergo: Storage rent</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020_04_21/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020_04_21/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Ergo use case: Local Exchange Trading System (LETS)</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020_04_03_1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020_04_03_1/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Ergo use case: ‘hot potato’ monetary policy</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020_04_03/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2020_04_03/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Ergo use case: Local Exchange Trading System (LETS)</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_04_02_use_cases/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_04_02_use_cases/</guid><description>The need to reform the global financial system has been clear since the last crisis in 2008. Now, COVID-19 has forced our hands. We cannot delay, and the best way to start is from the grassroots.
As lockdowns across the world effectively shut down whole sectors and a large part of the economy, we are entering a new era at breakneck pace. Central banks are taking unprecedented action in the form of money printing but, just like last time around, they will almost certainly fail at the ‘last mile’ (intentionally or otherwise): while their efforts will benefit the financial sector and the wealthy, the funds will not reach those small businesses and individuals who need them the most.</description></item><item><title>Ergo use case: ‘hot potato’ monetary policy</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_04_02_use_hot_potato/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_04_02_use_hot_potato/</guid><description>As the next financial crisis takes hold, it’s clear that conventional monetary policy is at its limit. Smart contract platforms like Ergo enable more innovative, targeted implementations of economic stimulation that the conventional banking sector cannot achieve.
Conventional monetary policy is a hammer. It works as far as it goes, but if all you have is a hammer then every problem starts to look like a nail.
When the Global Financial Crisis hit over a decade ago, central banks did what they were used to doing.</description></item><item><title>Ergo use cases: safe, simple financial contracts</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_03_29_ergo_use/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_03_29_ergo_use/</guid><description>Ergo enables new models of financial interaction, underpinned by smart contracts built on flexible and powerful Sigma protocols but easily accessible to developers.

You can use ErgoTool without running your own Ergo node. Even though running a node is the most secure way to communicate with the Ergo blockchain network, ErgoTool however, aims to provide more foundational tools at your disposal. Surely, you still can use it with your own running node.
In this post we will walk through simple steps to generate a mnemonic phrase, create a local secret storage and use it to send ERGs between addresses, all with the help of ErgoTool commands.</description></item><item><title>Mining Ergo for Fun and Profit</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_12_22_mining_for_fun/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_12_22_mining_for_fun/</guid><description>Ergo GPU Mining This article will help you start mining Ergo using a GPU.
Ergo mining is based on Autolykos, a Proof-of-Work algorithm designed to be ASIC and pool resistant. Miners have to perform memory-hard computations~(at least 4 GB memory is needed, but the current most efficient implementation utilizes between 8 GB of vRAM) that makes Ergo friendly for GPU mining. In addition, Autolykos requires access to private keys, thereby preventing mining pool formation.</description></item><item><title>ErgoTool: A Command Line Interface for Ergo blockchain</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2019_12_24/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2019_12_24/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Universal dApp Interface &amp; Package Standard</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2019_12_24_2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2019_12_24_2/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Early description of Ergo contractual approach</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2019_12_23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2019_12_23/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Ergo is using highly efficient AVL+ tree</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2019_12_23_2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2019_12_23_2/</guid><description/></item><item><title>New tutorial: 'Mining Ergo for Fun and Profit'</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2019_12_22/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2019_12_22/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Ergo Mainnet 3.1.5 released</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2019_12_19/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2019_12_19/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Ergo Cast: Understanding Ergo One Episode At A Time</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_12_16_podcast/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_12_16_podcast/</guid><description>Since the launch of the Ergo mainnet half a year ago, there has been an incredible amount of development and progress in the Ergo ecosystem.

Every week or two there's some truly novel idea or development put out, however if you're just an average blockchain enthusiast it's likely you haven't heard too much.
Why is that? The reason is that the Ergo ecosystem is making incredible strides forward in the technology side of things, however there is a distinct lack of content to consume for the average user who is interested.</description></item><item><title>A New Quest for Decentralization</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2019_12_12/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2019_12_12/</guid><description/></item><item><title>A New Quest for Decentralization, Part I: Technical Aspects</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_12_12_new_quest/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_12_12_new_quest/</guid><description>While most active conversations today in the space are about wider adoption of the blockchain technology (which often means selling out to the Wall St.) and competition with systems like Visa and Mastercard (which often means giving up with decentralization or introducing unclear security assumptions in the name of efficiency), there is the obvious need to revisit the roots of the cryptocurrency movement, which are mostly about decentralization.

Node security There are a few important aspects of node usage that your wallet and money's safety depends on:
An Ergo node requires storing security-critical parameters in the configuration file. You should never make this file public. An Ergo node provides a REST API for interacting with the built-in wallet. Sensitive API methods require a security token, which should never be sent over untrusted channels.</description></item><item><title>ERGO ($ERG) is listed on Probit Exchange</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2019_10_30/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2019_10_30/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Ergo Mainnet 3.1.3 released</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2019_10_29/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2019_10_29/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Ergo Mainnet 3.1.2 released</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2019_10_14/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2019_10_14/</guid><description/></item><item><title>ERGO ($ERG) is listed on HOTBIT Exchange</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2019_10_08_hotbit/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2019_10_08_hotbit/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Ergo Mainnet 3.1.1 released</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2019_10_08/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2019_10_08/</guid><description/></item><item><title>BISQ has officially added ERG</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2019_09_16/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2019_09_16/</guid><description/></item><item><title>ERGO ($ERG) is listed on P2PB2B Exchange</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2019_09_14/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2019_09_14/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Ergo and crowdfunding</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_09_06_crowdfund/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_09_06_crowdfund/</guid><description>What is Crowdfunding? Crowdfunding is a way of raising capital through the collective efforts of individuals. The campaigns are mostly started via the world wide web and allow projects and businesses to be funded by raising small amounts of money from a large number of people. One of the best known examples for successful crowdfunding startups is Oculus Rift, a virtual reality headset. The company Oculus VR initiated its campaign in 2012 and was only two years later acquired by Facebook for $2 billion total.</description></item><item><title>Ergo will be listed on Hotbit exchange</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2019_09_06/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2019_09_06/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Ergo Mainnet 3.1.0 released</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2019_08_27/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2019_08_27/</guid><description/></item><item><title>ERGO ($ERG) is listed on Vgate Exchange</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2019_08_20_1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2019_08_20_1/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Ergo Mainnet 3.0.7 released</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2019_08_20/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2019_08_20/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Mining ERGO on AMD Cards</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_08_07_amd/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_08_07_amd/</guid><description>This tutorial will provide you with the information needed to get your AMD cards mining ERGO on either Windows or Linux.

The wallet uses the BIP39 standard to generate a seed from a mnemonic sentence, which is then used to generate the private keys according to the BIP32 standard (Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets).

Part 1. Preliminaries An important design decision in a cryptocurrency protocol is specifying what a spending transaction actually spends. There are two possibilities here. The first a UTXO-based model, as in Bitcoin, where a transaction spends one-time asset containers (called as &amp;lsquo;coins&amp;rsquo; or UTXOs in Bitcoin) and creates new ones.</description></item><item><title>Ergo mining tutorial</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2019-04-03-ergo-mining-tutorial/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2019-04-03-ergo-mining-tutorial/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Testnet 2.0.3 released</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2019-04-02-testnet-2.0.3/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2019-04-02-testnet-2.0.3/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Q&amp;A session transcript.

What are the vision about scaling and adoption? About scaling, the main approach is to avoid bloat without compromising functionality. E.g. persistent updateable storage is possible, with updates to be checked by a blockchain contract, but only digest of authenticated data structure (and some additional bytes, less than 40 bytes anyway) are stored in the UTXO set dependless on data set size.</description></item><item><title>How to set up and configure full Ergo node</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2019-03-17-how-to-set-up-full-node/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/2019-03-17-how-to-set-up-full-node/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Testnet 2.0 is live!

Basically it means that just another buzzword is considered by big banksters as just another tool to extract value from everywhere in a more efficient way, and also to save on cutting job positions.
While I am avoiding to say anything about &amp;ldquo;Satoshi's vision&amp;rdquo; (nothing but speculations could be dug there after his exodus), a broad view I witnessed in the early years around online forums users is that a cryptocurrency should provide tools to enrich the ordinary people behind their small businesses providing no much above making ends meet, not depersonalized big financial capital.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/careers/frontend/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/careers/frontend/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Search</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/search/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/search/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
