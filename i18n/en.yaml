  translation: "Beginning more than ten years ago with Bitcoin, blockchain technology has so far proved to be a secure way of maintaining a public transaction ledger and disintermediating trusted third parties such as traditional financial institutions to some degree.
  However, whereas many teams have claimed to implement the next revolutionary blockchain, they also typically break at least one of the fundamental properties of blockchain technology that make it so powerful.
  <br/><br/>
  In contrast, Ergo platform absorbs ready-to-use ideas, that are well-tested and formalized in scientific papers. Its primary focus is to provide an efficient, secure and easy way to implement financial contracts that will be useful and survivable in the long term. Finally, Ergo is a self-amendable protocol, that allows it to absorb new ideas and improve itself in the future in a decentralized manner."

- id: ergo_decentralization_text
  translation: "The potentially outstanding resilience of a blockchain system is achieved by a combination of modern cryptographic algorithms and decentralized architecture. While cryptography is widely used outside of cryptocurrencies, decentralized architecture forms a unique property of blockchain systems making them even more secure due to a lack of single point of failure.
  <br/><br/>
  Ergo is built from the ground‐up to resist centralization at all levels. Ergo has both an ASIC and pool resistant Proof-of-Work algorithm, preventing blockchain centralization in the hands of miners and pool operators. Its treasury system prevents governance and development centralization, while light nodes with high-security guaranties prevent services centralization."

- id: ergo_economy_text
  translation: "To achieve survivability, Ergo provides economic improvements in addition to the technical ones, including an original economy model for a more secure and survivable network. A storage rent component makes Ergo similar to regular cloud storage services. However it has several significant consequences: it makes Ergo mining stable after the initial emission, prevents state size growth and provides a way to return lost coins to circulation.
  <br/><br/>
  Blockchain participants have to keep a significant amount of data in their local storages and the storage requirements are growing fast. Of this, certain data must be maintained in memory such as the entire state of the blockchain represented as the UTXO set in UTXO‐based protocols such as Bitcoin and Ergo. In platforms such as Bitcoin, miners receive no compensation for keeping this state and the network is subject to “state bloat” over time. However, Ergo miners will be compensated for state through the storage‐rent fee component to prevent bloating of full‐nodes. Moreover, the storage‐rent fee will provide an ongoing stable source of miner revenue, helping to insure a secure network even after the block reward subsidy runs out (after 8 years in Ergo)."

- id: ergo_contractual_text
  translation: "The overwhelming majority of successful public blockchain use-cases are about financial applications, even in platforms that claim to be general-purpose decentralized world computers. For example, if an oracle is writing non-financial data into a blockchain, this data is usually written to be used in a financial contract.
  <br/><br/>
  Ergo offers a powerful and protocol‐friendly scripting language based on Σ‐protocols (referred to as “Sigma Protocols”), that enables specifying conditions under which a coin can be used. In the simple case, a coin can be spent at any time by an owner of a secret key, but more complex spending conditions may specify multiple coin holders, the time of spending, to whom or what group the coins can be spent and so on, enabling the implementation of contracts of complexity far in excess of those of other secure distributed blockchains currently in existence."

- id: ergo_survivability_text
  translation: "Being a platform for contractual money, Ergo should also support long‐term contracts for a period of at least an average person’s lifetime. Ergo’s general approach is to use well-tested solutions proven to be secure in the long‐term.
  <br/><br/>
  A combination of PoW consensus protocol and authenticated state prevents performance degradation over time, allowing anyone to join the network and use it with commodity hardware. Ergo’s economy model makes the system more secure and reliable, while on‐chain governance allows gradual changes in the network parameters, a simple example being block size which will start at 524kb but miners can vote to increase it gradually over time in 1% increments."

- id: ergo_clients_text
  translation: "One of the key aspects of Ergo is that it is created for regular people. In particular, that means that they should be able to participate in the protocol by running a full node, mining or creating transactions and not have to rely on any trusted parties.
  <br/><br/>
  Ergo protocol is friendly to Light clients, allowing users to use it in a decentralized manner with full node security guarantees. The same properties of Ergo make it easier to implement sidechains, providing additional benefits in terms of throughput. "

  translation: "Ergo was created in response to stagnation in the blockchain area.
                It implements various technical and economic ready-to-use ideas that add value but do not reduce the known advantages of blockchain systems.
                Ergo’s primary focus is to provide an efficient and secure way to implement financial contracts, which are the most widely used application of blockchain technology.
                It is created to provide an easy way to use financial contracts by ordinary people, that should be able to use them in a decentralized manner without any trust.
                Unlike the traditional financial system, no bailouts, blacklists or other forms of discrimination should be possible on the core level of Ergo protocol.
                Ergo protocol is designed to be survivable in the long-term, making it useful to implement contracts for a period of a person’s life and also enabling it to be a good store of value.

- id: basics_consensus
  translation: "Consensus protocol of Ergo — <a href=\"https://docs.ergoplatform.com/ErgoPow.pdf\" class=\"eg-text__link eg-link\"><span>Autolykos</span></a> — is based on the well-known Proof-of-Work (“PoW”) consensus algorithm.
                  PoW was chosen for several reasons including that PoW protocols are widely studied, have high security guarantees, and are friendly to light clients.
                  However, Autolykos has several meaningful differences from Bitcoin's PoW.
                  First, it is memory-hard reducing the disparity between specialized hardware (ASICs) and commodity GPUs, allowing ordinary people to participate in mining to secure the network and receive the reward.
                  Second, Autolykos is the first production implementation of pool-resistant mining, which forces users to perform solo mining, thus keeping the network decentralized and without mining pools."

- id: basics_clients_title
  translation: Light Clients

- id: basics_clients
  translation: "It is almost impossible to use existing cryptocurrencies without the help of trusted third-parties. To receive even a small amount of coins in a trustless fashion, a client must download and process gigabytes of data to synchronize with the network, which may take several weeks even on high-end hardware, not to mention mobile devices. It is, therefore, no surprise that most users prefer to use trusted solutions for wallets, exchanges, block explorers and so on. <br/><br/>
                  Ergo was designed to be maximally user-friendly in the sense of decentralization. One of the important properties of PoW is that it enables verification of the work done without downloading the full chain. Ergo blocks support NiPoPoW proofs, allowing light clients to synchronize with the network by downloading less than a megabyte of data. Also, Ergo uses authenticated state, and for any transaction included, a client may download proof of its correctness. Thus, regardless of the blockchain size, a regular user with a smart-phone can join the network and start using Ergo with the same security guarantees as a full node."



- id: basics_survivability_title
  translation: Survivability

- id: basics_survivability
  translation: "To survive in the long-term, Ergo prefers well-tested solutions. If there isn't already a well-tested solution for some problem, we perform our own research, and the <a href=\"https://apograf.io/c/7MEY3\" class=\"eg-text__link eg-link\"><span>number of peer-reviewed papers</span></a> from the Ergo development team is already extensive.
                  <br/><br/>  A resilient network should adapt to changing environment without the intervention of trusted parties (such as a ``core developer`` team). Ergo's on-chain miner voting protocol allows gradual changes in a large number of parameters including maximum block size, storage fee factor and more.
                  <br/><br/> For more fundamental changes Ergo is going to follow a soft-forkability approach --- if an overwhelming majority of the network accepts a new feature, it is activated, however, old nodes which do not upgrade continue to operate normally and just skip over this feature validation.
                  Thus disruptive hard forks should not be required in Ergo.
  "

  translation: Economy

- id: basics_ecomony_paragraph
  translation: "
  To achieve survivability, Ergo provides economic improvements in addition to the technical ones, most central of which is a storage fee component which plays an important role for Ergo‘s stability: if an output remains in the state for 4 years without being moved, a miner may charge a small fee for every byte kept in the state.
  This idea is similar to regular cloud storage services, but it's application to blockchain systems has several significant consequences.
  First, Ergo mining will always be stable, unlike Bitcoin and other PoW currencies, in which mining may become unstable after the emission period.
  Second, state size growth becomes controllable and predictable reducing hardware requirements for Ergo miners. Third, by collecting storage fees from outdated boxes, miners return lost coins to circulation preventing a steady decrease of circulating supply due to lost keys. This also establishes a long‐term unique use case for <a class=\"eg-text__link eg-link\" href=\"https://docs.ergoplatform.com/ErgoPow.pdf\"><span>Ergo’s native token (“Erg”)</span></a> as the only token on the Ergo blockchain that can be used to pay for storage rent, despite the expected presence of a large number of non‐native tokens that may be issued on the Ergo blockchain in order to benefit from its strong security and decentralization qualities and Contractual Money functionality.  "

- id: basics_applicability_title
  translation: Applicability

- id: basics_applicability_paragraph
  translation: "
    Ergo DApps and offchain protocols may be implemented in a truly decentralized way due to light clients, however, they also require a flexible and safe smart contract language.
    Ergo smart contracts are based on a Bitcoin-like UTXO model, where every output is protected by some script.
    If the scripting language is rich enough, it enables writing of Turing-complete contracts while avoiding ad-hoc solutions for program halting like gas in Ethereum.
    While having significantly more versatility than Bitcoin script, Ergo script also contains operations, that allow accurate estimation of script complexity before execution, which prevents various DoS attacks and the “halting” problem.
    However, this instructions set is still sufficient enough to write any possible program — ErgoScript has been proven to be Turing complete.
    The cryptographic part of Ergo script is based on sigma protocols and naturally supports threshold m- of-n signatures, ring signatures and more.
    Keeping all this in mind, we expect ErgoScript and Ergo’s design to make it uniquely useful as Contractual Money with countless applications possible."

  translation: "Ergo is a Resilient Platform for Contractual Money. It is designed to be a platform for applications with the main focus to provide an efficient, secure and easy way to implement financial contracts. <br/><br/>
    To achieve this goal, Ergo includes various technical and economic improvements to existing blockchain solutions. Every coin in Ergo is protected by a program in ErgoScript, which is a powerful and protocol friendly scripting language based on Σ-protocols. It specifies conditions under which a coin can be used: who can spend them, when, under what external conditions, to whom, and so on. <br/><br/>
    Extended support of light nodes makes Ergo friendly for end users and allows it to run contracts on common devices such as mobile phones trustlessly. To be useful in the long-term, Ergo is strictly following a long‐term survivability approach — it uses widely-researched solutions that are not going to result in security issues in the future, while also preventing performance degradation over time with a new economic model. <br/><br/>
    Finally, Ergo is a self‐amendable protocol, that allows it to absorb new ideas and improve itself in the future.
    The focuses on long‐term survivability and self‐amendability are what give Ergo its resiliency.

- id: faq_second-item_text
  translation: "In our opinion, the overwhelming majority of successful public blockchain use‐cases are related to financial applications.
    Ergo is extending Bitcoin’s way of writing contracts by attaching a protecting script (together with additional custom data) to every coin.
    Thus Ergo applications are defined in terms of guarding scripts built into boxes also containing data involved in execution.
    We coin the term Contractual Money for Ergs and secondary tokens which usage is bounded by a contract.
    For example, in addition to regular protection by some m‐of‐n signature, Ergo allows specifying, who are the possible recipients of these coins, which may also be a contract with such complex conditions. This \"chaining\" approach allows implementing secure and efficient contracts of arbitrary complexity."

- id: faq_third-item_text
  translation: "Ergo is following the most decentralized way of emission and will start with zero coins in supply with the “minting” of the entire coin supply happening during the first eight years of Ergo mainnet, using the tried and tested PoW mining method. There was no ICO of Ergo."

  translation: "How to mine Ergo?"

- id: faq_fourth-item_text
  translation: "Ergo is based on Autolykos PoW puzzle, that is the first PoW puzzle that is memory-hard and pool-resistant.
  This means that you need a <a class=\"eg-text__link eg-link\" href=\"https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/wiki/Set-up-a-full-node\"><span>configured Ergo node</span></a> and GPU with at least 4 Gb of memory (while 8 Gb is recommended for maximum efficiency). Use this <a class=\"eg-text__link eg-link\" href=\"https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/wiki/Mining\"><span>guide</span></a> to configure miner together with the node. Note, that you may employ many GPUs together on one Ergo node."

  translation: "Why does Ergo have its own smart contract language?"

- id: faq_eighth-item_text
  translation: "The design space of programming languages is very broad ranging from
                general-purpose languages like C, Java, Python up to specialized languages
                like SQL, HTML, CSS,
                however, none of them was designed for the Contractual Money application.
                <br/><br/>
                ErgoScript was designed to achieve several properties.
                It only contains deterministic operations to maintain consensus in the network.
                To prevent possible spam attacks ErgoScript supports ahead-of-time cost estimation,
                excluding a wide range of operations like possibly infinite loops.
                But even keeping all these limitations in mind, ErgoScript is expressive enough to
                implement complex smart contracts, including Turing-complete smart contracts but in a secure manner."
