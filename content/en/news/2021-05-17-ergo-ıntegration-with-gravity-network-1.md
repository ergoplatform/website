title: Ergo Integration with Gravity Network
date: 2021-05-17T16:04:46.025Z
subtitle: After months of hard work, we’re happy to announce that we’ve
  completed the cross-chain tests and the Gravity-Ergo-Proxy contracts are
  almost complete. This partnership will help Ergo access different chains like
  the Binance Smart Chain, Ethereum, NEO, Solana, thanks to the use of Gravity
  Network. At the same time, other platforms will use the complex and rich
  design of Ergo to take new dApp ideas to their chains.
