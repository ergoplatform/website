title: Ergo Integration with Gravity Network
date: 2021-05-17T14:46:07.033Z
subtitle: After months of hard work, we’re happy to announce that we’ve
  completed the cross-chain tests and the Gravity-Ergo-Proxy contracts are
  almost complete. This partnership will help Ergo access different chains
  thanks to the use of Gravity Network. At the same time, other platforms will
  use the complex and rich design of Ergo to take new dApp ideas to their
  chains.
